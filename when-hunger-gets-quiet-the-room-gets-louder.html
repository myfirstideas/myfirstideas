In the last few years, conversations about bodies have been threaded with new vocabulary and a different sort of urgency. Appetite can be tuned, tempered, steered. But the quieter it becomes, the more we hear everything else.</p><p>Not long ago, I sat in a kitchen where the coffee was strong and the silence stronger. A friend said they felt “finally in control,” and another nodded, “but at what cost?” Nobody clarified the cost. We just passed the sugar bowl like a relay baton, as if sweetness could answer something that language was afraid to try.</p><p>There’s a subtle paradox in the culture right now: the promise of ease and the reality of complexity living in the same breath. Tools exist that can change the rhythms of eating. Meanwhile, the stories we carry about hunger—its moral tint, its shadowy edges, its history tangled with shame and celebration—do not change nearly as quickly.</p><p>We inherit certain scripts. That discipline equals virtue. That less is cleaner, more admirable, more likely to be applauded. We also inherit the opposite script, the one that insists joy is a heaping plate, a second helping, a refusal to be small. It’s no wonder the inner monologue sounds like a crowded panel. When someone reaches for a lever that might soften the noise, the panel doesn’t disappear; it just argues in whispers.</p><p>What strikes me is how care is often imagined as a single doorway—walk through, problem solved—when it is more like a corridor lined with listening rooms. In one room, a person hopes for relief from relentless preoccupation with food. In another, someone longs to feel safe around a plate again, to unclench the jaw of control. Somewhere between those rooms is a thin wall where risk and relief lean against each other, exchanging breath.</p><p>The language of screening belongs here. Not as a bureaucratic step, but as a ritual of attention. Screening is the pause that asks, who are you when you’re hungry and who are you when you’re not? What histories are knocking from the other side of the wall? It’s a temperament check, a mapping of fault lines, an acknowledgment that there are basements beneath every house.</p><p>I read a thoughtful piece recently about risks and the place of screening in safer care—its cadence was careful, the tone almost like someone turning a dimmer switch rather than flipping a light. It reminded me that thoughtful attention is itself a form of protection. The link lives here for anyone who wants the texture of that reflection: <a href="https://canadianinsulin.com/articles/ozempic-and-eating-disorders-risks-screening-support/">a discussion of risks, screening, and support</a>.</p><p>I think about the moments we mistake silence for peace. An appetite quieted can feel like relief, and sometimes it is. But quiet can also amplify other rooms: anxiety, expectation, identity. To notice which room is speaking louder after the hush is not about moral judgment; it’s about mapping the architecture of a life.</p><p>There’s a meteorological feel to these conversations—clouds, pressure systems, the slow shift of fronts. Out in the world, body-talk flickers like weather alerts, pushing people to take cover or step outside. Some find shelter in numbers, shared experiences, a sense of collective recalibration. Others feel the old ache return, set to a new soundtrack. Both can be true at once, and often are.</p><p>What helps is a certain pace. Slowness is not denial; it’s a way of hearing. The pause before a decision, the check-in after, the willingness to name changes that are helpful and those that land with a thud. Slowness lets the room be lit from multiple angles. It gives language time to arrive without the urge to prosecute it.</p><p>I keep returning to the image of a table, not as a battlefield but as a calendar. Meals mark time, and any shift in how we approach them changes our sense of days passing. If a tool alters the cadence, the calendar changes too. That’s worth noticing. It isn’t an accusation or a celebration—just a note on the wall: the rhythm is different here.</p><p>Some people talk about thresholds. When does attention become obsession? When does relief shade into avoidance? The trickiness is that thresholds are personal, more like tides than fences. This is why listening matters—because the same stretch of water can be a crossing for one person and a riptide for another.</p><p>I’m wary of declarations, the ones that march in with certainty. Bodies are not podiums. They are apartments with thin walls and neighbors who move furniture at odd hours. What we can do, maybe, is keep the hallway light on. If a decision is made, check whether the rooms feel safer, not just quieter. If a decision is deferred, see whether the noise has information tucked inside it. If professionals are involved, hope they are fluent in the language of both appetite and story.</p><p>All of this feels less like an answer and more like choreography. A step toward ease, a step back to assess balance, a pivot to consider history. The measure of care is not silence but congruence: the sound of a life and the shape of its choices finding a workable harmony.</p><p>In the kitchen where this began, we ran out of coffee and made tea, a small compromise that felt almost ceremonial. No one tried to fix the conversation. We let it hover, as if uncertainty deserved a saucer of its own. Somewhere between sips, I realized the room hadn’t gotten quieter at all; it had become clearer. And clarity, unlike silence, has room for a future.</p>
