If you're paying cash for GLP-1 therapy, focus on apples-to-apples comparisons, not a single “lowest” number.

Key drivers of cash quotes:
- Medication/package billed (single vs multiple units)
- Dispensing/service fees (retail vs mail)
- Days supplied (28–30 vs other)
- Program/discount network rules
- Format differences (oral vs injectable) and cadence

Quick compare checklist:
1) Confirm exact product and package form
2) Ask if the quote is retail cash or program-based
3) Verify all fees included in the total
4) Confirm days-supply used for pricing
5) Ask how long the quote is valid

Notes:
- Assistance programs have strict eligibility and documentation
- Beware “too-good-to-be-true” offers; verify approved products
