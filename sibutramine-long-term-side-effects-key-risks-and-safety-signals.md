Key points on sibutramine’s long-term safety:

- Withdrawn in many regions after higher rates of serious cardiovascular events, especially in people with heart disease or multiple risk factors.
- Long-term exposure can show as persistent increases in heart rate/BP, palpitations, tremor, sweating, headaches, insomnia, anxiety, or irritability.
- Hidden ingredients risk: some “slimming” products may contain undeclared sibutramine—document product names, photos, and receipts.
- Interaction hazards: combinations with serotonergic or stimulant drugs can raise harm; watch for agitation, confusion, fever, sweating, diarrhea, tremor, rigidity, or uncoordinated movements.
- Practical steps: map a timeline (start/stop/symptom onset), list everything taken (including caffeine and OTCs), check baseline risks, capture pulse/BP/temperature, and recognize red flags:
  - Chest pain, fainting, severe shortness of breath → urgent care
  - Fast heartbeat + tremor/agitation → prompt clinical review
  - Persistent insomnia/anxiety/mood changes → non-urgent appointment
  - Severe headache with neurologic changes → emergency evaluation
